### Bonjour, I'm Pierrick 🇫🇷

I am a full-time Solidity Engineer at PoolTogether, a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain for no-loss prize games. 

I am most proud of my versatility, jumping from Front-End Developer at my last company to Solidity engineer at PoolTogether. My time working in France as a Front-End Developer honed my coding and design skills. 

Now, I build smart contracts responsible for moving funds deposited by our users into autonomous interest rate protocols like Compound to generate yield that is then awarded to some lucky winners. This way, we help people save money while having a chance to win prizes.

My passion for Ethereum began by participating in hackathons and collaborating with others in the Ethereum community. I am actively involved in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on the Ethereum blockchain and I have won several Ethereum hackathons.

### My Experience

I have six years of experience as a Front-End engineer working for startups and large size companies. 

For four years, I worked as a Front-End Developer specializing in JavaScript and accessibility at a midsize company, the number one real estate appraisal platform in France. In my role at Meilleurs Agents, my team and I created performant and easy to use interfaces that privileged transparency in the real estate business. We built both B2B and B2C tools. 

During this time, I worked on a team of Front-End engineers that began with four engineers and grew to sixteen. Within my team I collaborated with our UX/UI designers, product managers, and other software engineers. I spearheaded initiatives within Meilleurs Agents to adopt Typescript and standardize design tokens across all our apps and platforms.

Aside from coding, I have an eye for design and enjoyed participating in design studios and feature prioritization. My day to day often involved coding, unit testing and end to end testing, data-driven decision making, and contributing to our reusable components library.
