### Bonjour, I'm Pierrick ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

By day I am a Front-End Developer specializing in JavaScript and accessibility at a midsize company, the number one real estate appraisal platform in France. By night I am actively involved in various Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on the Ethereum blockchain. I have recently won several Ethereum hackathons.

In my current role at Meilleurs Agents my team and I create performant and easy to use interfaces that privilege transparency in the real estate business. We build both B2B and B2C tools.

Within my team I collaborate with our UX/UI designers, product managers, and other software engineers. Aside from coding, I have an eye for design and enjoy participating in design studios and feature prioritization. My day to day often involves coding, unit testing and end to end testing, data-driven decision making, and contributing to our reusable components library. I recently spearheaded initiatives within my company to adopt Typescript and standardize design tokens across all our apps and platforms.

### My Experience

I have six years of experience as a Front-End engineer working for startups and large size companies. In the span of the last four years, I have collaborated on a team of Front-End engineers that began with four engineers and grew to sixteen.

My Ethereum experience comes out of participating in hackathons and collaborating with others in the Ethereum community.
