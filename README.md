## Bonjour, I'm Pierrick ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

I am a full-time Solidity Engineer at M^0, a stablecoin infrastructure for the next-generation of finance on the Ethereum blockchain.

I am most proud of my versatility, jumping from Front-End Developer for six years to Solidity engineer at PoolTogether and then M^0. My time working in France as a Front-End Developer honed my coding and design skills.
Now, I build smart contracts responsible of minting $M, a stablecoin backed by US Treasury Bills, and facilitating its widespread adoption by integrating with layer twos blockchains and various DeFi products.

My passion for Ethereum began by participating in hackathons and collaborating with others in the Ethereum community. I am actively involved in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on the Ethereum blockchain and I have won several Ethereum hackathons.


## My Experience

I have three years of experience as a Smart Contract Engineer working in small and autonomous teams.

Before building smart contracts I worked as a Front-End engineer in startups and large size companies for six years.

During my last four years as a Front-End Developer my team and I created performant and easy-to-use interfaces that privileged transparency in the real estate business. We built both B2B and B2C tools.

During this time I worked on a team of Front-End engineers that originally began with four engineers and grew to sixteen. Within my team I collaborated with our UX/UI designers, product managers, and other software engineers. I spearheaded initiatives within our company, Meilleurs Agents, to adopt Typescript and standardize design tokens across all our apps and platforms.

Aside from coding I have an eye for design and I enjoy participating in design studios and feature prioritization. My day-to-day often involves designing scalable smart contracts architectures, unit testing and end-to-end testing as well as data-driven decision making.
